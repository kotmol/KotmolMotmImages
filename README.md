# Kotmol Molecule Of The Month (Motm) image cache

This repo holds generated images of molecules featured
in the world-famous "Molecule Of The Month".

The images are derived from images from https://rcsb.org
and are converted to have a transparent background
instead of white.  This works better in an Android
app under development in "Dark Mode".

* [docs/MotmImages.md] contains images converted from TIF format provided 
by the Molecule Of the Month / PDB101 feature at https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/motm-about

* [docs/MotmThumbnailImages.md] contains a composite of the Molecule of the Month
thumbnail images after transparent background conversion.

* [docs/PdbImages.md] contains a composite of the Protein Data Bank images

Use of these images is consistent with the RCSB policies available at:
